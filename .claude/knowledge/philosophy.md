# Project Philosophy

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
   - Only add complexity when necessary
   - Code should be self-documenting

2. **Safety Always**
   - Never use force flags
   - Always backup before destructive operations
   - Test before committing

3. **Iterative Progress**
   - Small, focused commits
   - One feature per PR
   - Continuous improvement

4. **Clear Communication**
   - Write descriptive commit messages
   - Document decisions
   - Keep retrospectives

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Over-engineering
- Premature optimization
- Skipping tests
- Force-pushing

## Decision Framework

When making choices:
1. Does it solve the problem simply?
2. Is it safe and reversible?
3. Will it be maintainable?
4. Is it well-documented?
